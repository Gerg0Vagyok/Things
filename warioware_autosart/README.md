## UNTESTED - Probably works tho.
### For Windows:
    x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -static main.c -o warioware.exe
### For Linux:
    gcc -static main.c -o warioware
## ADDITIONAL NOTES
 - I don't own a Mac, nor have SDK for compiling to Mac, so RIP Mac
   users.
 - It has everything in it, using it is a piece of cake, just
   launch the executable, no dependencies i think.
 - Its written in C.
 - Launching the program itself doesn't do anything that you can see,
   you have to re-login. or restart, I have no idea.
